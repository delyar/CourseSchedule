run: I recommend you to use python http.server to run a very simple web server. Assuming Python 3 is already installed on your computer, from Terminal (or PowerShell, Git Bash), you can run: python -m http.server 8080
You may use npm http-server or similar libraries instead.
If you are using Python 2, your command is slightly different. It's like: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080.
Then you can open your web browser, and go to http://localhost:8080/cs565_hw4c.html
